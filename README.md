# Resource Checker API

## The idea of this project is to launcha container that opens a port to check cpu and memory usage of a EC2 instance via API

We will keep it simple, reading FIXED lines in the /proc/meminfo, if you want to do it rading multiple lines, please make the python function before, and then we talk.
